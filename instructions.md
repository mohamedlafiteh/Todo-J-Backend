# Part-1

# Task-1

# The steps I followed :-

    1. Navigated to services  > lambda function > created function
    2. Gave the function description name
    3. Created new role with the same prefix(segregate it from the rest of AWS)
    4. I didn't choose the template for the role
    5. In the code editor exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const response = { statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify('Hello world!'),    };
    return response;};
    6. Created new test event with an empty request object because the function did not depend on the event
    7.  I ran the new test event and obtained the following result Response:

{
"statusCode": 200,
"body": "\"Hello world!\""
}

REPORT Duration: 9.31 ms Billed Duration: 100 ms Memory Size: 128 MB Max Memory Used: 75 MB Init Duration: 162.99 ms.```

**Because the duration was 9.31 ms, and the function does not depend on the input it safe to cap execution duration to 1 s instead of the default 3s
I did testing running the function many times and checked the results of the duration time, to make a decision about the right time that should be used to execute the function, limit the time that function could go on so we don't pay more than we should.**

# Task-2

# The steps I followed :-

1. Search for api getway
2. Create API
3. Then choose the third option  Import from Swagger or Open API 3
4. Post the swagger data in
5. The end point type regional
6. Then press import
7. In the integration request
8. Chose lambda function and region and myhellow world
9. Back to action in resources then choose the deploy api and give it name prod then deploy
10. I received url and when I paste it in the browser I get error “internal error”
11. Great resource from the action with name of the function
12. Create method from the action get
13. Deploy api to prod

13. Created a branch and extracted the update task and test into different folder.

14. Created a branch and extracted, created task and test into different folder.

15. Created a branch and extracted, updated task partially and test into different folder.

16. Created a branch and extracted, deleted task and test into different folder.

17. Created a branch and extracted get tasks and test into different folder.

18. Created a branch and extracted get task by ID and test into different folder.
